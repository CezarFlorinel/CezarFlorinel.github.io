							 <p> The answer is a very big YES! If you ever feel stressed you can use this amazing machine to calm yourself down. Just like taking a walk in the park, this machine can help you get rid of those negative emotions and enjoy your life . Does your boss make you angry? Go for a walk. Does your wife asks you for money? Go for a walk. Does you children ask you to buy them a PS5 , even tho they are vrey rare and the prices from resellers are insanely big? GO FOR A WALK! </p>

                            <header> Does this machine make you stronger? </header>
							<p> Well... YEAH , it does make you gain those beautiful muscles . As you walk on the walkingpad you burn calories and you lose body fat, if you have a low amount of body fat your abdominal muscles are going to become visible , aka you are going to have those nice abs, which all girls love. So, what are you waiting for ? Go ahead and build those nice abs and get some girls or mans , I am not here to judge you. </p>

                             <header> My child is playing video games all day and he doesn't do sport . What should I do? </header>
							 <p> Your answer is right here. Change his chair with a walkingpad and this way he will play video games while doing exercise . Throw his chair away so that every time he plays a game, he would have to do some walking. He will either give up on video games or build up a lot of muscles, either way is good in my opinion. Also be careful that he will take a shower from time to time , otherwise you are all going to die.</p>
